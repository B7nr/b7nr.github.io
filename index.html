<p>My name is Ben Rehfeld and I am seventeen years old. I am a junior at St. John XXIII College Preparatory. I have been a lifegaurd for the past two years.  This is my second year teaching swim lessons. I have been swimming for ten years. Nine of those ten years have swam competitively for Katy Aquatics. Not only have I swam for Katy Aquatics, but also for my high school swim team. This  year I became the State Champion in the 200 free for TAPPS Division II.</p>

<p>I drive to the pool of your choice, whether it is a public pool or a private pool.</p>

<a id="Pricing paragraph" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> Pricing</h3>

<a id="Evaluation paragragh" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fifteen Minute Evaluation Lesson</h3>

<p>For a new client there is a free fifteen minute evaluation lesson. During this lesson I evaluate the swimmer and come up with a specialized lesson plan, so that the swimmer can reach their goals by the end of the summer. Whether the goal is to learn how to swim without floaties, or to learn a new stroke. The price will also be discussed for the following lessons.</p>
