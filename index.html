<a id="About me paragraph" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Ben Rehfeld and I am seventeen years old. I am a junior in high school. I have been a lifegaurd for the past two years. This is my second year teaching swim lessons. I have been swimming for ten years. Nine of those ten years, I have swam competitively for a local club. Not only have I swam for my club team, but also for my high school swim team.</p>

<a id="Evaluation paragraph" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluation Lesson</h3>

<p>For a new client there is a free fifteen minute evaluation lesson. During this lesson I evaluate the swimmer and come up with a specialized lesson plan, so that the swimmer can reach their goals by the end of the summer. Whether the goal is to learn how to swim without floaties, or to learn a new stroke.</p>

<p>I offer swim lessons  to swimmers of all skill levels and ages. The lessons can range from learning how to swim to learning how to improve technique and speed of all four strokes.</p>
